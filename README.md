# UART-design-in-verilog-
UART Modules in Verilog  This repository contains UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) modules designed in Verilog. These modules are designed to facilitate reliable serial communication between digital systems and are suitable for FPGA-based projects and custom hardware implementations.

this module along with the color sensor modules in another repository was used for implementation of a bot video here----->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjADuEFHBC8
